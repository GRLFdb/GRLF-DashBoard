Reading .CSV files
  Main functionality of the dashboard. This would allow us to get the data the sensors have recorded and correctly apply it to the areas 
  its needed. 
  There are a couple of different solutions out there by different people. For instance, we can import two libraries - Ajax, to retrieve
the data from a URL and Papa Parse, to parse the file (Based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36104089/read-csv-file-from-a-
location-and-display-as-html-table). Other solutions state that we can use Jquery and Papa Parse to read .CSV files (https://www.js-
tutorials.com/javascript-tutorial/reading-csv-file-using-javascript-html5/), however this may just be local .CSV's only. There are 
solutions for taking .CSV data and putting it into a HTML Table, which would be great for the leaderboard 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36104089/read-csv-file-from-a-location-and-display-as-html-table) Anyways, implementation of this 
feature will probably be started after 11/8/2018 to give us time to prepare for the test Dr. Moorman will give us.
